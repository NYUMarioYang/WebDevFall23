      <p> If you’re interested in my Live2D works and want to commission me for a Live 2d model, please fill out this
        form that let me know more about your request.</p>
      <!-- form link below-->
      <a class="center-text" href="https://forms.gle/testtest">Commission Form</a>

      <ul>
        <li>I will send you a confirmation email to discuss more of your request if I’m able to take this commission
        </li>
        <li>If you are interested in commissioning me, please fill out the application form on the APPLY page.</li>
        <li>I will select the styles I like most. And reply to the application form by email and discuss the commission
          details with you. I will make a price estimation based on your demand.</li>
        <li>After confirming there's no problem with the price, the schedule and other details about the commission, you
          would need to pay 50% of the full payment up front to secure the spot (I will send you Paypal invoice for
          payment).</li>
        <li>After receiving the deposit, I will put your commission into my schedule. Before starting to work on your
          commission, I will contact you to confirm the details of the commission again.</li>
        <li>When working on your commission, I will send you regular updates.</li>
        <li>For rigging commissions, normally I will send updates 4 times during the process in the form of videos when
          the following have been completed: (a) eye blinking and mouth, (b) head angles (without physics), (c) body
          movements and (d) when the rigging is almost done.</li>
        <li>For model art commissions, normally I will send updates 4 times during the process in the form of
          screenshots when the following have been completed: (a) sketch, (b) line art, (c) coloring, and (d) when the
          mode art is almost done.</li>
        <li>After receiving the updates, please feel free to ask for anything changed or edited. You are encouraged to
          provide feedback during the process to ensure the quality of the final work.</li>
        <li>To check the commission progress, you can contact me or visit my Trello.</li>
        <li>After receiving the final update (when the work is almost done), you can make a list of any revision you
          want made. I will make final revisions accordingly. Once you are happy with the final work, the final 50% of
          the payment will be due.</li>
        <li>After receiving the rest of the payment, I will send you the final commission file. If you still want minor
          revisions after delivery of the final work, please contact me because they might be free.</li>
        <li>During the commission process, minor revisions are free (but there is a certain threshold for the quantity
          of minor revisions). Major revisions before and after delivering the completed work are not free.</li>
        <li>The price for any addition to the model will be discussed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Please note!!!</h2>
      <p>If I do not receive the materials required two weeks before our commission date, the commission will be
        postponed or canceled</p>
