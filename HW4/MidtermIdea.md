**Idea: Create a website for work showcase and commission submission**
![Alt text](Images/gura.gif)
* Live2D: A software that allows 2D models to be animated in real-time. Its core is the combination of a proprietary file and a JSON file that defines animations.
* Hence the website will have less work but hopefully interactive 
* The goal is to create a website that displays work in a straightforward manner, and allows users to submit commission requests.
